# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"

Convert websites to Canadian, even tho no-one asked for it ;)

As an international student who doesn't know a lot of Canandian terms or slang I wanted other international students like me to learn faster by forcing Google to become more Canadian and replacing words to their Canadian counterpart

This is meant for comedic purposes only and maybe to learn some Canadian slang.

It replaces some common words to their Canadian alternative

Try searching Couch, Starbucks, Coffee, Beer, Soda, Toilet, Mac and cheese, or ask Google a question.
